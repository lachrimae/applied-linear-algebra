# applied algebra linear algebra work

I wrote this code for an applied algebra course, in order to improve my understand of core linear algebra operations. The code is organized around a test suite at the bottom of `gram_schmidt.py`, which verifies that I have correctly programmed the Gram Schmidt orthonormalization process. The tests also apply the Gram-Schmidt process used to verify whether a vector is a member of a given subspace.

To run the tests, run `python gram_schmidt.py` using a recent version of Python. I am using Python 3.10 but I am guessing you could run this with Python at least as old as 3.6-3.9 without trouble.
